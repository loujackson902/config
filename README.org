#+TITLE: Configs
#+DESCRIPTION: Tracking my shell configs for demonstrative purposes.

* Shell
My preferred user Shell is ZSH.
If Starship is present on the system it is evaluated in the zshrc file for a fancy prompt.

I have taken many of my configs from LukeSmith, and DistroTube, then modified them to my preferences.

Not everything is well documented but perhaps that will change in the future.
